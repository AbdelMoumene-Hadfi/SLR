# SLR (Simple LR)
LR parsing is one type of bottom up parsing. It is used to parse the large class of grammars .

SLR parser is a type of LR parser with small parse tables and a relatively simple parser generator algorithm. As with other types of LR(1) parser, an SLR parser is quite efficient at finding the single correct bottom-up parse in a single left-to-right scan over the input stream, without guesswork or backtracking.
